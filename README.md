# DSMARKET - END TO END MACHINE LEARNING
We are five alumni of the Nuclio Digital School, Barcelona, Spain.
This repository contains our Master Thesis for the Data Science & A.I. Master (DSC0324).
The project is a Role Play practice exercise that aims to recreate a realistic working scenario for a Data Scientist.
In this project we are helping DSMarket, a small chain of shopping centers, to improve their most important internal processes, such as sales predictions, price estimation, stock optimization, etc.
